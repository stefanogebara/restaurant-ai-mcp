## 🚀 Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Customer Reservation Bot (COMPLETED)
- Multi-modal interface (voice + text chat)
- Natural conversation flow for making reservations
- Real-time table availability checking
- Confirmation and booking
- **Status**: Fully implemented and deployed

### ✅ Phase 2: Host Dashboard (100% COMPLETE - PRODUCTION READY)
All host dashboard functionality is fully operational in production.

**Completed Features:**
- Dashboard layout with table grid visualization (Indoor, Patio, Bar sections) ✅
- Walk-in flow: Add customer details → Find available tables → Confirm seating ✅
- **Reservation check-in flow**: Check in → Find available tables → Seat party ✅
- Service Records: Full CRUD operations working (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ✅
- Complete Service flow: Mark party departed, update tables to Available ✅
- Table status display (Available, Occupied, Reserved, Being Cleaned) ✅
- Real-time polling (30-second refresh) ✅
- Stats dashboard: Total capacity, available seats, occupancy %, active parties ✅
- Active parties panel: Shows customer name, party size, tables, seated time ✅
- Reservations calendar: Displays all upcoming reservations with check-in buttons ✅

**Reservation Check-In Workflow:**
1. Host clicks "Check In" button on any reservation in calendar
2. CheckInModal displays reservation details (customer name, party size, time, special requests)
3. System finds available tables and recommends 3 best options with scoring
4. Host selects preferred table option
5. System proceeds to SeatPartyModal for final confirmation
6. Party is seated, service record created, tables marked as occupied

**Key Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed 404 routing error with SPA configuration in vercel.json
- Service Records table discovered to be fully configured (all 11 fields)
- SERVICE_RECORDS_TABLE_ID already added to Vercel (Oct 12)
- Reservation check-in flow fully tested and verified in production

**Optional Future Enhancements:**
- Mark Table Clean workflow (optional - tables auto-return to Available)
- Manual table status management
- VIP guest flagging

### 📋 Phase 3: Advanced Features (PLANNED)
- Waitlist management
- Customer preferences and history
- Analytics and reporting
- Multi-location support

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue #1: Walk-in Seating 500 Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "Unknown field name: 'Service ID'" when seating walk-in customers

**Root Cause**: Service Records table exists but only has 3 of 11 required fields configured

**Fix Applied**:
- Documented all required fields in SERVICE_RECORDS_SETUP.md
- Partially configured table via Airtable web UI (3 fields done)
- Remaining 8 fields must be added manually

**Status**: Waiting for manual table configuration completion

### Issue #2: Table Number vs Record ID Confusion ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: API tried to update tables using table numbers (like "4") instead of Airtable record IDs (like "rec123abc")

**Fix Applied** (Commits: 422c4cf, 7f767ac, 881ee1b):
- Added lookup logic to convert table numbers to record IDs
- Used `getAllTables()` to get all records, then filter by table_number
- Applied `Number()` coercion to handle string/number type mismatches
- Fixed in both `handleSeatParty` and `handleCompleteService`

**Code Location**: `api/routes/host-dashboard.js:258-290`

### Issue #3: Missing table_ids in WalkInModal ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: WalkInModal didn't extract table_ids from API response, causing 400 error

**Fix Applied** (Commit: 422c4cf):
```typescript
onSuccess: (response) => {
  const recommendation = response.data.recommendation;
  onSuccess({
    type: 'walk-in',
    ...formData,
    party_size: parseInt(formData.party_size),
    table_ids: recommendation?.tables || [],  // ✅ Added this line
    recommendations: response.data,
  });
}
```

**Code Location**: `client/src/components/host/WalkInModal.tsx:19-32`

### Issue #4: ElevenLabs LLM Parameter Extraction Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: "Invalid message received: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)" error in ElevenLabs conversations when calling `create_reservation` tool

**Root Cause** (Discovered via Playwright investigation):
- LLM was extracting date value (e.g., "2025-10-30") into the `party_size` parameter instead of the actual party count (e.g., "2")
- The `date` parameter was missing entirely from tool calls
- Original `party_size` description was too vague: "Number of guests"
- This caused the webhook to fail with "Missing required parameter: date"

**Investigation Method**:
- Used Playwright to navigate ElevenLabs dashboard
- Examined failed conversation (conv_5201k7n2ggpefmasdenawxem608c) transcription
- Clicked "Result" button on failed tool call to see exact LLM-extracted parameters
- Compared with successful conversation to identify pattern

**Fix Applied** (Oct 16, 2025):
Updated `party_size` parameter description in ElevenLabs Tools configuration:
- **Before**: "Number of guests"
- **After**: "Number of people dining (e.g., 2, 4, 6). This must be a NUMBER, not a date. Example: if 2 people are dining, use 2."

**Files Created**:
- `api/elevenlabs-webhook.js`: Unified webhook wrapper with comprehensive error handling (Commit: fda32d2)

**Status**: Fix applied to ElevenLabs tool configuration. Ready for testing with new conversation.

**Testing Instructions**:
1. Call the ElevenLabs agent phone number
2. Request a reservation (e.g., "I'd like to make a reservation for 2 people tomorrow at 7 PM")
3. Go to https://elevenlabs.io/app/agents/history
4. Click on the most recent conversation
5. Verify that the `create_reservation` tool call shows:
   - `party_size`: 2 (number, not date)
   - `date`: "2025-10-30" (actual date value)
   - No error message about missing date parameter

### Issue #5: Dashboard Stats Not Counting Manually Occupied Tables ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: When table 11 was manually marked as "Occupied" (without a service record), the dashboard stats (occupied seats, occupancy %) didn't update.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard stats calculation only counted tables with active service records, ignoring manually occupied tables.

**Fix Applied** (Oct 18, 2025):
Updated `api/routes/host-dashboard.js:99-106` to count BOTH:
- Active service records (seated parties with service IDs)
- Manually occupied tables without service records

**Code Location**: `api/routes/host-dashboard.js:handleGetDashboard`

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Dashboard now correctly counts all occupied tables

### Issue #6: Calendar Not Showing Reservations - TypeScript Build Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Reservations calendar component was empty despite 9 reservations existing in Airtable. Production API returned 0 reservations.

**Root Cause Discovery Process**:
1. Verified environment variable `RESERVATIONS_TABLE_ID=tbloL2huXFYQluomn` was correct in Vercel
2. Triggered multiple redeployments - issue persisted
3. Examined Vercel logs - discovered production was running OLD code from commit `50f69ca`
4. Found that "Redeploy" feature redeploys the SAME commit, not latest code
5. Discovered all commits after `2d21783` (calendar feature) were failing to build
6. Root cause: TypeScript compilation error in `ReservationsCalendar.tsx`

**TypeScript Error**:
```
src/components/host/ReservationsCalendar.tsx(17,32): error TS2339: Property 'date' does not exist on type 'UpcomingReservation'.
src/components/host/ReservationsCalendar.tsx(29,25): error TS2339: Property 'time' does not exist on type 'UpcomingReservation'.
```

**Fix Applied** (Oct 18, 2025 - Commit: 26427bf):
Added missing fields to `UpcomingReservation` interface in `client/src/types/host.types.ts`:
```typescript
export interface UpcomingReservation {
  reservation_id: string;
  customer_name: string;
  customer_phone: string;
  party_size: number;
  date: string;              // ✅ Added
  time: string;              // ✅ Added
  reservation_time: string;
  special_requests?: string;
  checked_in: boolean;
  checked_in_at?: string;
  status?: string;           // ✅ Added
  record_id?: string;        // ✅ Added
}
```

**Key Discovery**: Vercel's "Redeploy" button redeploys the SAME commit. To deploy latest code, must push new commits.

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Production now shows all 9 reservations including Jonas (Party of 3, Oct 19, 8PM)

### Testing URLs
- Production: https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/host-dashboard
- Local Dev: http://localhost:8086/host-dashboard

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

1. **DO NOT delete or modify the "Tables" table** (`tbl0r7fkhuoasis56`)
   - This is the primary source of truth for table availability
   - Has actual table records (Table 1-10)
   - All table assignments reference this table

2. **API Key Permissions**
   - Current Airtable API key has read/write but NOT schema modification
   - Cannot create tables or fields programmatically
   - Must use web UI for table structure changes

3. **Table Number Types**
   - Always use `Number()` coercion when comparing table numbers
   - Airtable may return strings or numbers inconsistently
   - Use `Number(t.table_number) === Number(tableNum)`

4. **Service Records Status**
   - Table exists but is NOT production-ready
   - Must complete field configuration before testing walk-in flow
   - Follow SERVICE_RECORDS_SETUP.md instructions

5. **Don't confuse tables**
   - "Tables" table = physical restaurant tables
   - "Restaurant Tables" = duplicate/legacy
   - "Service Records" = active dining sessions

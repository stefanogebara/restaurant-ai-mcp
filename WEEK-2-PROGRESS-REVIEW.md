4. **Small Dataset**: Only 7 labeled records (vs 1000+ target)

**Data Quality Findings**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Data Limitations**:

## üêõ Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue #1: NaN Values in Edge Cases (Day 9) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: 3 tests failing because temporal features returned NaN for invalid input

**Error Message**:
```
expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 19
Received: NaN
```

**Root Cause**: Missing isNaN() checks after parsing

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Before:
const hour = parseInt(time.split(':')[0]);
return Math.max(0, Math.min(23, hour)); // Returns NaN if parse fails

// After:
const hour = parseInt(time.split(':')[0]);
if (isNaN(hour)) return 19; // Default to 7 PM
return Math.max(0, Math.min(23, hour));
```

**Affected Functions**:
- `calculateHourOfDay()` - Line 88
- `calculateDayOfWeek()` - Line 105
- `calculateMonthOfYear()` - Line 122

**Result**: All 83 tests passing ‚úÖ

---

### Issue #2: Empty Test File Causing Jest Failure (Day 9) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Jest failing with "test suite must contain at least one test"

**Error Message**:
```
FAIL  api/_lib/availability-calculator.test.js
  ‚óè Test suite failed to run
    Your test suite must contain at least one test.
```

**Root Cause**: Empty test file existed from previous development

**Fix Applied**:
```bash
rm api/_lib/availability-calculator.test.js
```

**Result**: Test suite runs cleanly ‚úÖ

---

### Issue #3: Wrong Status Values in Export Script (Day 10) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: Script looking for lowercase "completed" but Airtable uses "Completed"

**Discovery Method**: Created `inspect-airtable-data.js` to view actual data

**Actual Status Values**:
- "Confirmed"
- "Cancelled"
- "Seated"
- "Completed"

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Before:
return status === 'completed' || status === 'no-show';

// After:
return status === 'Completed' || status === 'Cancelled';
```

**Note**: Using "Cancelled" as proxy for no-shows since no explicit no-show status exists

**Result**: Successfully filtered 7 labeled reservations ‚úÖ

---

### Issue #4: Validation Rejecting Metadata Fields (Day 10) ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem**: `validateFeatureVector()` checking metadata fields that aren't ML features

**Error Message**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid features for RES-20251026-6676: reservation_id is not numeric: string
```

**Root Cause**: Validation expects only 23 numeric features, not metadata

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Exclude metadata before validation
const featuresToValidate = { ...features };
delete featuresToValidate.no_show;
delete featuresToValidate.reservation_id;
delete featuresToValidate.actual_status;

const validation = validateFeatureVector(featuresToValidate);
```

**File Modified**: `scripts/export-training-data.js:206-210`

**Result**: 100% validation success rate (7/7 records) ‚úÖ

## üéØ Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (Days 11-12)

‚úÖ **Proceed with Option A: Complete Pipeline with Test Data**

**Reasoning**:
1. Validates entire ML pipeline (feature ‚Üí model ‚Üí prediction)
2. Low time investment (4-5 hours)
3. Documents process for future
4. Identifies integration issues early
5. Ready to retrain when real data arrives

2. Train/test split (5 train, 2 test)
3. Model evaluation metrics
4. Prediction API endpoint
5. Model versioning system

**What NOT to Do**:

- ‚ùå Use model for real predictions
- ‚ùå Claim model is production-ready

**Documentation to Create**:
- Training process documentation
- Model evaluation report
- "HOW TO RETRAIN WITH REAL DATA" guide
- Integration guide for Day 13

---

### Long-Term Data Collection Strategy

**Goal**: Collect 1000+ reservations over 6-12 months

**Action Items**:
1. **Ensure All Reservations Are Tracked**
   - Verify every reservation gets a status (Completed/Cancelled/No-Show)
   - Add explicit "No-Show" status to Airtable
   - Track walk-ins in addition to reservations

2. **Track Cancellation Reasons**
   - Add cancellation_reason field
   - Distinguish: "Customer cancelled" vs "Restaurant cancelled" vs "No-show"
   - This improves model accuracy

3. **Improve Class Balance**
   - Current: 86% no-shows (too high!)
   - Industry: 15-20% no-shows
   - **Action**: Investigate why cancellation rate is so high
   - Consider: Confirmation reminders, deposit requirements, better policies

4. **Verify Data Quality**
   - Fix placeholder dates (all showing 2025-01-01)
   - Ensure booking_created_at timestamps are accurate
   - Track real customer history

5. **Set Monthly Export Schedule**
   - Run export script monthly
   - Monitor dataset growth
   - Watch for class balance improvements
   - Retrain model when you hit 1000+ records

**Timeline**:
- Month 1: 40-100 reservations
- Month 3: 150-300 reservations
- Month 6: 300-600 reservations
- **Month 12: 600-1200 reservations ‚Üí RETRAIN MODEL**

## üîÆ Looking Ahead

### Week 2 Completion (Days 11-14)

**Days 11-12: Model Training Pipeline**
- Build XGBoost training script
- Document process for future retraining
- Create evaluation framework
- Test end-to-end pipeline

**Day 13: Production Integration**
- Deploy feature extraction
- Add to reservation flow
- Dashboard integration
- Mock predictions (until model ready)

**Day 14: Deployment & Monitoring**
- Production deployment
- Monitoring setup
- Documentation
- Week 2 completion review

**Expected Completion**: 2-3 more sessions

---

### Week 3 Preview (After Week 2)

**If Model Ready** (1000+ records collected):
- Week 3 Days 15-18: Model Optimization
- Week 3 Days 19-20: A/B Testing
- Week 3 Day 21: Production Monitoring

**If Model NOT Ready** (Still collecting data):
- Deploy feature engineering to production
- Monitor data collection
- Focus on other platform features
- Revisit ML training in 6-12 months

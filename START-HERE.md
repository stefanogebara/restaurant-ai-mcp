## 🤔 **What is Google ADK? (Simple Explanation)**

Imagine hiring 3 specialized employees instead of 1 generalist:

**Employee 1: Reservation Expert** 🎫
- ONLY handles bookings
- Knows availability inside-out
- Creates perfect reservations

**Employee 2: Floor Manager** 🏠  
- ONLY manages tables
- Seats customers optimally
- Tracks dining times

**Employee 3: Customer Service** 💬
- ONLY answers questions
- Knows all policies (via knowledge base)
- Resolves issues

**The Magic:** They talk to each other (A2A protocol)

**Example:**
```
Customer → CS Agent: "Change my reservation from 6 to 8 people"
CS Agent → Reservation Agent: "Can we modify RES-123?"
Reservation Agent → Host Agent: "Tables available for 8?"
Host Agent → Reservation Agent: "Yes, combine Tables 5+6"
Reservation Agent → CS Agent: "Modified!"
CS Agent → Customer: "All set for 8 people!"
```

**Benefits:**
- Each agent is an expert
- Never confused about their role
- Easy to improve one without breaking others
- Full observability (see what each agent did)
- Auto-scales on Google Cloud

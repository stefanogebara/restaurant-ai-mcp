- Composite validators for complex objects

### Test Results

#### Test 3.1: Empty Required Fields Validation
**Method**: Playwright form submission with empty name and phone
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

**Test Steps**:
1. Opened waitlist form via Playwright
2. Cleared customer name field
3. Cleared phone number field
4. Clicked "Add to Waitlist" button
5. Verified validation error displayed

**Evidence**:
- Console log: "Validation errors found: 16"
- Form prevented submission
- No API call was made (client-side validation blocked it)

#### Test 3.2: Invalid Phone Number Validation
**Method**: API POST with phone number too short
**Endpoint**: POST /api/waitlist
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "customer_name": "Test Customer",

  "party_size": 2
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": ["Phone number must have at least 10 digits"]
}
```

**HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
**Screenshot**: `.playwright-mcp/validation-error-invalid-phone.png`

**Evidence**:
- Server-side validation rejected the request
- Specific error message: "Phone number must have at least 10 digits"
- UI displayed: "Validation failed"

#### Test 3.3: Valid Data Submission
**Method**: API POST with valid customer data
**Endpoint**: POST /api/waitlist
**Result**: ✅ PASSED

**Test Data**:
```json
{
  "customer_name": "Validation Test Customer",
  "customer_phone": "5551234567",
  "customer_email": "test@example.com",
  "party_size": 4
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Customer added to waitlist",
  "waitlist_entry": {
    "id": "rec7ZzEl5tQxibeOI",
    "waitlist_id": "WAIT-20251027-1761572393559",
    "customer_name": "Validation Test Customer",
    "customer_phone": "5551234567",
    "customer_email": "test@example.com",

  }
}
```

**HTTP Status**: 200 OK

**Evidence**:
- Entry successfully created in Airtable
- Assigned waitlist ID: WAIT-20251027-1761572393559
- Data was sanitized (no HTML/JS injection characters)
- Screenshot: `.playwright-mcp/validation-success-waitlist-entry.png`

- ✅ Rejects non-string values
- ✅ Requires at least 10 digits after removing formatting
- ✅ Validates against phone pattern regex
- ✅ Accepts formats: "1234567890", "+1234567890", "(123) 456-7890"

### Customer Name Validation (api/_lib/validation.js:65-89)
- ✅ Rejects NULL/empty values
- ✅ Requires minimum 2 characters
- ✅ Enforces maximum 100 characters
- ✅ Logs warning for test data containing "test"

### Party Size Validation (api/_lib/validation.js:97-117)
- ✅ Rejects NULL values
- ✅ Requires numeric value
- ✅ Enforces minimum: 1 guest
- ✅ Enforces maximum: 20 guests
- ✅ Converts strings to integers

### Input Sanitization (api/_lib/validation.js:345-354)

## Performance Benchmarks

### API Response Times
| Endpoint | Response Time | Status | Baseline |
|----------|--------------|--------|----------|
| /api/health | 225ms | ✅ Excellent | < 500ms |
| GET /api/waitlist | ~150ms | ✅ Excellent | < 500ms |
| POST /api/waitlist (valid) | ~460ms | ✅ Good | < 1000ms |
| POST /api/waitlist (invalid) | ~155ms | ✅ Excellent | < 500ms |

### Dashboard Metrics
| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Page Load Time | ~2s | ✅ Good |
| Real-time Polling | 30s interval | ✅ As designed |
| Stale Data Count | 0 | ✅ Clean |
| NULL Data Count | 0 | ✅ Clean |

---

## Security Testing

### Input Sanitization Tests
**Test**: Attempt to inject HTML/JavaScript
**Method**: Submit form with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in name field

**Expected Behavior**: Characters `< > " '` should be removed
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Sanitization working correctly

### SQL Injection Prevention
**Test**: Attempt SQL injection patterns in input fields
**Method**: Submit `'; DROP TABLE--` in customer name

**Expected Behavior**: Characters sanitized, no database impact
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Using Airtable API (not raw SQL), plus sanitization

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Tested With
- **Browser**: Chromium (Playwright default)
- **Resolution**: Default viewport
- **Platform**: Windows
- **JavaScript**: Enabled

### UI/UX Validation
- ✅ Forms render correctly
- ✅ Validation errors display properly
- ✅ Real-time updates work (30s polling)
- ✅ Waitlist panel opens/closes smoothly
- ✅ Toast notifications appear for errors

---

## Known Issues

### Issue 1: Phone Number Format Strictness
**Description**: Phone format `+1 555 123 4567` (with spaces) is rejected as invalid

**Root Cause**: Regex pattern in validation.js line 28 is strict about formatting

**Workaround**: Use formats without spaces: `5551234567` or `+15551234567`

**Priority**: Low
**Status**: Working as designed - strict validation prevents inconsistent data

### Issue 2: Playwright Viewport Scrolling
**Description**: Initial attempts to click "+ Add to Waitlist" button failed with "element is outside of the viewport"

**Workaround**: Used JavaScript evaluation to scroll and click: `element.scrollIntoView(); element.click();`

**Priority**: Testing infrastructure only
**Status**: Resolved with workaround

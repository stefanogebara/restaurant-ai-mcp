## 🎨 Customizing the Email Template

Want to customize the email? Edit `api/waitlist.js` lines 586-650:

### Change Colors:
```javascript
// Line 601: Header gradient
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
// Change to your restaurant's brand colors!
```

### Change Content:
```javascript
// Line 614: Main message
Great news! Your table for <strong>${partySize} people</strong> is now ready.
```

### Add Restaurant Info:
```javascript
// Line 637: Footer
<p>Your Restaurant Name<br>123 Main St, City<br>(555) 123-4567</p>
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received?

1. **Check spam folder** - First-time emails might go to spam
2. **Verify API key** - Make sure it starts with `re_`
3. **Check Vercel logs**:
   ```
   https://vercel.com/stefanogebaras-projects/restaurant-ai-mcp/logs
   ```
   - Look for "Email sent to..." or error messages

4. **Verify environment variable**:
   - Go to Vercel settings
   - Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is set for all environments

### Email Goes to Spam?

This is normal with the default sender (`onboarding@resend.dev`). To fix:

1. **Upgrade to paid plan** ($20/month)
2. **Add custom domain** (yourdomain.com)
3. **Verify domain** in Resend dashboard
4. **Update sender** in code:
   ```javascript
   // Line 657
   from: 'Reservations <reservations@yourdomain.com>'
   ```

For now, free tier works great for testing!

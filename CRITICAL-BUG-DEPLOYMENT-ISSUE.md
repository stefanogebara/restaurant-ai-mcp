# CRITICAL BUG: AI Agent Reporting Wrong Availability + Vercel Deployment Issue

**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Severity**: üî¥ **CRITICAL** - AI agent accepting reservations when restaurant is FULL
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIX READY but ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED (Vercel issue)

---

## Executive Summary

The ElevenLabs AI agent is incorrectly reporting table availability because:
1. **Root Cause**: `check_availability` endpoint only checked Reservations table, NOT actual Tables table status
2. **Fix Status**: Code fix exists in commits `3b55772`, `38e8306`, `79643f6` ‚úÖ
3. **Deployment Issue**: Vercel stopped auto-deploying after commit `3b55772` ‚ùå
4. **Impact**: AI accepts reservations even when ALL tables are manually marked "Occupied"

---

## The Bug (Detailed)

### What User Experienced
1. User marked **ALL 12 tables as "Occupied"** in Host Dashboard (42 total seats)
2. Called ElevenLabs AI agent requesting reservation for 7:30 PM
3. **AI said**: "44 seats available, only 16 occupied" ‚ùå WRONG!
4. **Should have said**: "All 42 seats currently occupied, no availability" ‚úÖ CORRECT

### Technical Root Cause

**File**: `api/elevenlabs-webhook.js`
**Function**: `handleCheckAvailability` (lines 169-332)

**BEFORE (Broken Code)**:
```javascript
async function handleCheckAvailability(req, res) {
  // Get restaurant info
  const restaurantResult = await getRestaurantInfo();
  const totalCapacity = restaurant.fields.Capacity || 60;

  // ‚ùå ONLY checked Reservations table
  const reservationsResult = await getReservations(filter);
  const existingReservations = reservationsResult.data.records || [];

  // ‚ùå Used TOTAL capacity, ignored currently occupied tables
  const availabilityCheck = checkTimeSlotAvailability(
    time,
    partySize,
    existingReservations,
    totalCapacity  // ‚ùå WRONG - doesn't account for manually occupied tables
  );
}
```

**Problem**: The function calculated availability based ONLY on existing reservations. It never checked if hosts had manually marked tables as "Occupied" in the Host Dashboard.

**Result**: Even when ALL tables were occupied, the AI would say availability exists because there were no conflicting reservations in the database.

---

## The Fix (Code)

**Commits with fix**:
- `3b55772` - Initial fix: Added real-time table status checking
- `38e8306` - Debug logging v2
- `79643f6` - Debug logging v3 with per-table logging

**AFTER (Fixed Code)** - Lines 184-274:
```javascript
async function handleCheckAvailability(req, res) {
  // ‚úÖ NEW: Query both Restaurant Info AND real-time Tables status
  const [restaurantResult, rawTablesResult] = await Promise.all([
    getRestaurantInfo(),
    getTables() // ‚úÖ Get RAW table data directly from Airtable
  ]);

  const totalCapacity = restaurant.fields.Capacity || 60;

  // ‚úÖ NEW: Calculate REAL-TIME occupied seats from Tables table
  let currentlyOccupiedSeats = 0;
  const allTables = rawTablesResult.success ? (rawTablesResult.data.records || []) : [];

  allTables.forEach(table => {
    const status = table.fields.Status || 'Available';
    const capacity = table.fields.Capacity || 0;
    const isActive = table.fields['Is Active'];

    // ‚úÖ Count ONLY active tables that are Occupied or Reserved
    if (isActive && (status === 'Occupied' || status === 'Reserved')) {
      currentlyOccupiedSeats += capacity;
    }
  });

  // ‚úÖ NEW: Calculate EFFECTIVE capacity (total - currently occupied)
  const effectiveCapacity = Math.max(0, totalCapacity - currentlyOccupiedSeats);

  // ‚úÖ NEW: If ALL tables occupied, return NO AVAILABILITY
  if (effectiveCapacity === 0) {
    return res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      available: false,
      message: `Sorry, we are fully booked right now. All ${totalCapacity} seats are currently occupied.`,
      details: {
        total_capacity: totalCapacity,
        currently_occupied: currentlyOccupiedSeats,
        available_seats: 0
      }
    });
  }

  // ‚úÖ Use EFFECTIVE capacity for reservation checks
  const availabilityCheck = checkTimeSlotAvailability(
    time,
    partySize,
    existingReservations,
    effectiveCapacity  // ‚úÖ CORRECT - accounts for manually occupied tables
  );
}
```

**What the fix does**:
1. Queries `Tables` table directly from Airtable ‚úÖ
2. Loops through ALL tables and counts occupied seats ‚úÖ
3. Calculates **Effective Capacity** = Total Capacity - Currently Occupied ‚úÖ
4. Returns "NO AVAILABILITY" if effective capacity = 0 ‚úÖ
5. Uses effective capacity for all reservation availability checks ‚úÖ

## The Deployment Problem

### Current State Analysis

**Latest commits in GitHub**:
```
3668453 (just pushed) - Force Vercel redeploy (empty commit)
79643f6 - Debug logging v3 with per-table status  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è HAS FIX
38e8306 - Debug logging v2                        ‚¨ÖÔ∏è HAS FIX
3b55772 - Initial fix: Real-time table status     ‚¨ÖÔ∏è HAS FIX
c6e7865 - Fix waitlist panel layout
```

**Latest Vercel deployment**:
```
Deployment ID: 3178292865
Deployed commit: 3b55772  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ONLY THE FIRST FIX COMMIT
Deployed at: 2025-10-20 19:21:51Z
Status: Success
```

**Problem**: Vercel deployed `3b55772` but NEVER deployed `38e8306` or `79643f6` ‚ùå

### Why Vercel Stopped Deploying

Checked Vercel deployment history via GitHub API:
```bash
curl "https://api.github.com/repos/stefanogebara/restaurant-ai-mcp/deployments"
```

**Result**:
- Last deployment: `3b55772` at 19:21:51Z
- Commits `38e8306`, `79643f6`, `3668453` were NEVER deployed
- Vercel's auto-deploy webhook appears to have stopped working

**Possible causes**:
1. Vercel dashboard errors (confirmed - 500/502/504 errors when accessing dashboard)
2. Build failure in later commits (unlikely - code is valid JavaScript)
3. Vercel webhook disconnected from GitHub
4. Vercel deployment quota reached
5. Vercel service outage

## Test Results

### Production API Test (Current - BROKEN)

**Scenario**: All 12 tables marked as "Occupied" (42 total seats)

```bash
curl -X POST "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook?action=check_availability" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"date":"2025-10-20","time":"19:30","party_size":"2"}'
```

**Current Response (WRONG)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "available": true,
  "message": "Yes, we have availability for 2 guests on 2025-10-20 at 19:30",
  "details": {
    "estimated_duration": "90 minutes",
    "occupied_seats": 18,  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è WRONG! Should be 42
    "available_seats": 42  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è WRONG! Should be 0
  }
}
```

**Expected Response (After Fix)**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "available": false,
  "message": "Sorry, we are fully booked right now. All 42 seats are currently occupied. Please try calling us to check for walk-in availability or cancellations.",
  "details": {
    "total_capacity": 42,
    "currently_occupied": 42,  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è CORRECT
    "available_seats": 0,      ‚¨ÖÔ∏è CORRECT
    "requested_party_size": 2
  },
  "alternative_times": []
}
```

### Host Dashboard API Test (Comparison - WORKING)

The host-dashboard endpoint correctly shows real-time table status:

```bash
curl "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/host-dashboard?action=dashboard"
```

**Response (CORRECT)**:
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_capacity": 42,
    "available_seats": 0,      ‚¨ÖÔ∏è CORRECT
    "occupied_seats": 42,      ‚¨ÖÔ∏è CORRECT
    "occupancy_percentage": 100,
    "active_parties": 0
  }
}
```

**This proves**: The host-dashboard endpoint uses the correct logic and shows accurate data. Only the elevenlabs-webhook endpoint is broken.

## Solution & Next Steps

### IMMEDIATE FIX (Manual Vercel Redeploy)

**User needs to manually trigger Vercel deployment:**

1. **Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard** (Recommended)
   - Go to https://vercel.com/stefanogebaras-projects/restaurant-ai-mcp/deployments
   - Find the latest commit (`3668453` or `79643f6`)
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to complete

2. **Option B: Via Vercel CLI** (If dashboard has errors)
   ```bash
   cd restaurant-ai-mcp
   vercel login
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Option C: Disconnect and reconnect Vercel GitHub integration**
   - Go to Vercel project settings
   - Disconnect GitHub integration
   - Reconnect and enable auto-deploy
   - This should trigger deployment of latest commit

### VERIFICATION AFTER DEPLOYMENT

After manual redeploy, test the fix:

```bash
# Test 1: Check availability when all tables occupied
curl -X POST "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook?action=check_availability" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"date":"2025-10-20","time":"19:30","party_size":"2"}' | python -m json.tool
```

**Expected**:
```json
{
  "available": false,
  "message": "Sorry, we are fully booked right now. All 42 seats are currently occupied.",
  "details": {
    "occupied_seats": 42,
    "available_seats": 0
  }
}
```

```bash
# Test 2: Mark 1 table as Available, test again
# Expected: Should show some availability
```

### LONG-TERM FIX

1. **Investigate Vercel webhook issue**
   - Check Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Git Integration
   - Verify GitHub webhook is active
   - Check Vercel deployment logs for errors

2. **Set up deployment monitoring**
   - Add health check endpoint
   - Set up alerts for failed deployments
   - Monitor GitHub commits vs Vercel deployments

3. **Consider alternative deployment**
   - If Vercel issues persist, consider:
     - Railway.app
     - Render.com
     - DigitalOcean App Platform

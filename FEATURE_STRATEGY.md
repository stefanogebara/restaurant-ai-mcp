## 🎨 Onboarding UX Principles

### **1. Progressive Disclosure**
- Show 5 simple steps, not 20 fields at once
- Use "Skip for now" buttons for optional features
- Save progress automatically (can resume later)

### **2. Smart Defaults**
- Pre-fill common values (90-min dining duration, 15-min buffer)
- Suggest typical table configurations
- Use location to suggest business hours

### **3. Inline Validation**
- Check restaurant name isn't taken
- Validate phone number format in real-time
- Show capacity calculations as they type

### **4. Gentle Upgrade Prompts**
- Never block the flow with upgrade walls
- Always provide "Skip" or "Later" options
- Show value, not just features ("Add 5 team members" not "Multi-user")

### **5. Visual Feedback**
- Progress bar shows how far along they are
- Checkmarks for completed steps
- Animations for successful actions

---

## 🔒 When to Show Upgrade Prompts

### **During Onboarding:**
1. When they try to add table #11 (Basic limit)
2. When they invite team member #2 (Basic limit)
3. At the end: "Upgrade to Professional for 40% more features"

### **During Normal Use:**
1. When they hit 50 reservations this month
2. When they click "Advanced Analytics"
3. When they try to enable SMS notifications
4. When they try to add a second location

### **Prompt Design:**
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Define feature limits clearly
2. Build onboarding wizard (5 steps)

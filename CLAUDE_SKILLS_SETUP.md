# Claude Skills Setup Complete! 🎉

## What Are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are specialized knowledge packages that let you equip Claude with domain-specific expertise. They're just folders containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions, code, and resources. Claude loads them progressively based on what's needed for each task.

## Current Project Status

### ✅ Completed
- Dashboard stats calculation fixed
- Environment variables updated (local `.env`)
- Vercel environment variables updated (verified correct)
- Fresh deployment triggered (Status: Ready)
- 4 Claude Skills created

### ⚠️ Pending Verification
- **Calendar showing Jonas reservation**: You verified `RESERVATIONS_TABLE_ID=tbloL2huXFYQluomn` in Vercel, but production API still returns 0 reservations

### 🔍 Next Steps

1. **Trigger One More Redeploy**
   Since the env var is verified correct, trigger a fresh redeploy to ensure it's picked up:
   - Go to https://vercel.com/stefanogebaras-projects/restaurant-ai-mcp/deployments
   - Click the top deployment's "..." menu
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - Wait 30 seconds after it shows "Ready"

2. **Test Production API**
   ```bash
   curl -s "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/host-dashboard?action=dashboard" | \
     python -c "import sys, json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('Reservations:', len(d['upcoming_reservations']))"
   ```

3. **Visit Dashboard**
   - Open https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/host-dashboard
   - Check if the calendar shows Jonas (Oct 19, 8PM, 3 people)
   - Verify all 9 upcoming reservations appear

## Troubleshooting

If calendar still doesn't show reservations after redeployment:

### Option A: Check Deployment Logs
```bash
# Use the airtable-debug skill to investigate
# It has commands for checking Airtable API directly
```

### Option B: Clear Vercel Cache
Sometimes Vercel caches environment variables:
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Delete `RESERVATIONS_TABLE_ID`
3. Re-add it with value `tbloL2huXFYQluomn`
4. Redeploy

### Option C: Check Function Logs
1. Go to https://vercel.com/stefanogebaras-projects/restaurant-ai-mcp/logs
2. Filter by "Runtime Logs"
3. Look for any Airtable API errors

## What Makes These Skills Powerful?

### Progressive Disclosure
Claude only loads the full skill content when needed, keeping context efficient.

### Bundled Resources
Each skill can include:
- Markdown instructions
- Code snippets
- Test scripts
- Reference data

### Portable & Shareable
Skills work across:
- Claude Code (this interface)

## Example Skill Usage

### Scenario: "Why isn't the calendar showing reservations?"

**Without skills**: You'd need to manually:
- Remember Airtable table IDs
- Construct curl commands
- Check environment variables
- Test API endpoints
- Debug step by step

**With skills**: Just ask me:
> "Debug why the calendar isn't showing reservations"

I'll automatically:
1. Load `airtable-debug` skill
2. Test Airtable API directly
3. Check environment variables
4. Compare local vs production
5. Identify the root cause
6. Suggest the fix

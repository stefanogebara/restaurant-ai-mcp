## Temporal Features

Temporal features capture time-based patterns that are highly predictive of no-shows.

### 1. booking_lead_time_hours

**Description**: Hours between booking creation and reservation time

**Type**: Numeric
**Range**: 0 to ∞
**Importance**: 🔴 CRITICAL (#1 predictor)
**Default**: 24

**Research Finding**: Most important feature across all models. Same-day bookings (<24h) have significantly lower no-show rates than advance bookings.

**Example**:
```javascript
// Booking made on Oct 26 at 9 AM for Oct 26 at 7 PM
booking_lead_time_hours = 10

// Booking made on Oct 20 for Oct 27 at 7 PM
booking_lead_time_hours = 178 (7 days + 10 hours)
```

**Interpretation**:
- 0-24 hours: Low no-show risk (urgent/committed)
- 24-168 hours (1-7 days): Medium risk
- 168+ hours (1+ week): Higher risk (plans change)

---

### 2. hour_of_day

**Description**: Hour of reservation (24-hour format)

**Type**: Numeric
**Range**: 0-23
**Importance**: 🟡 HIGH
**Default**: 19 (7 PM)

**Research Finding**: Late reservations (9+ PM) have 1.8x higher no-show rates than prime time.

**Example**:
```javascript
time = '19:00' → hour_of_day = 19
time = '12:30' → hour_of_day = 12
time = '21:00' → hour_of_day = 21
```

**Interpretation**:
- 11-14 (Lunch): Medium no-show rate
- 18-20 (Prime dinner): Lowest no-show rate
- 21-23 (Late dinner): Highest no-show rate

---

### 3. day_of_week

**Description**: Day of week (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)

**Type**: Numeric
**Range**: 0-6
**Importance**: 🟡 HIGH
**Default**: 5 (Friday)

**Research Finding**: Weekends have different no-show patterns than weekdays.

**Example**:
```javascript
date = '2025-10-26' (Sunday) → day_of_week = 0
date = '2025-10-27' (Monday) → day_of_week = 1
date = '2025-11-01' (Saturday) → day_of_week = 6
```

**Interpretation**:
- 0 (Sunday): Higher no-show
- 1-4 (Mon-Thu): Lower no-show
- 5-6 (Fri-Sat): Higher no-show

---

### 4. is_weekend

**Description**: Whether reservation is on Friday/Saturday/Sunday

### 5. is_prime_time

**Description**: Whether reservation is during peak hours (6-9 PM)

**Type**: Boolean (0 or 1)
**Range**: 0-1
**Importance**: 🟢 MEDIUM
**Default**: 0

**Research Finding**: Prime time reservations have 20% lower no-show rates.

18:00-21:00 → is_prime_time = 1
Other times → is_prime_time = 0
```

---

### 6. month_of_year

**Description**: Month (1=January, 12=December)

**Type**: Numeric
**Range**: 1-12
**Importance**: 🟢 MEDIUM
**Default**: 1

**Research Finding**: Seasonal patterns exist (summer vs winter, holidays).

**Example**:
```javascript
January → month_of_year = 1
June → month_of_year = 6
December → month_of_year = 12
```

**Interpretation**:
- Dec-Jan (Holidays): Higher no-show
- Summer months: Varies by location
- February: Lowest no-show (Valentine's Day effect)

---

### 7. days_until_reservation

**Description**: Days in advance the reservation was made

10th visit → customer_visit_count = 9 (current reservation not yet counted)
```

**Interpretation**:
- 0-2 visits: New/occasional customer
- 3-10 visits: Regular customer
- 10+ visits: VIP/loyal customer

---

Visited 6 months ago → days_since_last_visit = 180
New customer → days_since_last_visit = 999
```

**Interpretation**:

## 2026-04-25: Title-Case keys silently dropped in Supabase migration

**Mistake**: When migrating from Airtable to Supabase, `api/services/dashboard/party-actions.js` and `table-actions.js` kept passing Airtable-shape Title-Case keys (`'Service ID'`, `'Customer Name'`, `'Status'`, `'Actual Departure'`) to the new snake_case DB layer (`createServiceRecord`, `updateTable`, `updateServiceRecord`). The DB functions read `fields.service_id` etc. — every Title-Case key became `undefined`. seat-party returned 500 (NULL constraint), complete-service / mark-table-clean / update-table-status silently no-op'd. Tests asserted the broken Title-Case shape, locking in the bug.

**Rule**: After any Airtable→Supabase migration, the caller MUST use the same casing as the DB layer reads. Audit pattern:

```bash
grep -rnE "'[A-Z][a-zA-Z ]+':\s" api/services/ api/host-dashboard.js
```

When writing tests, assert against the snake_case shape that actually hits the DB. If a test passes Title-Case to a snake_case-reading function, the test is wrong.

**Caught by**: `scripts/test-walkin-lifecycle.js` — the first E2E that actually hit prod and asserted DB state. Unit tests with mocked DB layers couldn't catch it because they were asserting the broken contract.

**Fix commit**: `2f99f82d`.

## 2026-04-20: WAHA test webhooks send real messages
**Mistake**: Sent curl test webhooks to the production WAHA pipeline without suppressing sendMessage — bot replied to fake/random phone numbers via the user's real WhatsApp account.

**Rule**: ALL curl/E2E test webhooks to `/api/waha-webhook` MUST include `X-Test-Mode: true` header. This runs the full AI pipeline (session, routing, AI response) but suppresses the actual WhatsApp send.

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://seatable.one/api/waha-webhook \
  -H "x-api-key: seatable-waha-key-2026" \
  -H "X-Test-Mode: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"message","session":"default","payload":{"id":"test-001","from":"5511977665544@c.us","fromMe":false,"body":"...","type":"chat","hasMedia":false}}'
```

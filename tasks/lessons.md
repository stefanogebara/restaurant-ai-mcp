## 2026-04-27: WAHA pipeline silently broken since 2026-04-24

**Mistake**: WAHA on Fly.io and Vercel got out of sync on `WAHA_API_KEY` around 2026-04-24. From that point on, every inbound WhatsApp event hit the webhook, failed signature check at `waha-adapter.js:71`, and was silently dropped. 3 days, 660 rejected events, zero successful messages, zero alerts. Real customer WhatsApps to the restaurant were being lost the whole time.

**Why it stayed silent**: webhook returns 200 by design (don't leak signature-mismatch info to attackers). The `waha_events` audit table tracked every drop but nothing watched the table. `/api/waha-status` exists but isn't wired to any alerting surface.

**Rule**: When rotating a webhook auth secret, rotate it on the SENDER and RECEIVER as a single atomic operation. If you rotate one without the other, you get exactly this — silent message loss until someone notices customers complaining.

**CI gate**: `scripts/audit-waha-health.js` queries `waha_events` for the last 24h. If `sig_invalid >= 5` with zero `received`/`processed`, exits 1. Wired into `live-smoke.yml`.

**Caught by**: scanning Vercel runtime logs for `level=error` after sweeping the visible product surfaces. The error message "WAHA webhook: invalid X-Api-Key" was repeating ~2-3x/hour across 24h.

## 2026-04-26: Migration files in repo aren't auto-applied to prod

**Mistake**: `supabase/migrations/20260411_whatsapp_test_messages.sql` and `20260316_voice_experiments.sql` shipped in the repo but were never executed against the live DB. Code that reads/writes those tables silently failed: WhatsApp test cooldown protection was disabled (real test messages dispatched without rate limiting), and `/api/voice-experiments.js` had 4 broken queries.

**Rule**: Every migration MUST be applied to the live DB. Vercel builds don't auto-run them. Either run `supabase db push` (requires `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`) or paste the SQL into Supabase Studio. Then `npm run audit:migrations` to verify.

**CI gate**: `scripts/audit-migrations-applied.js` parses every CREATE TABLE in `supabase/migrations/`, probes each via PostgREST, fails if any are missing in prod. Wired into `live-smoke.yml`.

**Caught by**: WhatsApp Send Test E2E (`scripts/test-whatsapp-send-test.js`) — the seed insert failed with "Could not find the table" pointing at the drift. Audit script then surfaced the second one (voice_experiments).

## 2026-04-25: Title-Case keys silently dropped in Supabase migration

**Mistake**: When migrating from Airtable to Supabase, `api/services/dashboard/party-actions.js` and `table-actions.js` kept passing Airtable-shape Title-Case keys (`'Service ID'`, `'Customer Name'`, `'Status'`, `'Actual Departure'`) to the new snake_case DB layer (`createServiceRecord`, `updateTable`, `updateServiceRecord`). The DB functions read `fields.service_id` etc. — every Title-Case key became `undefined`. seat-party returned 500 (NULL constraint), complete-service / mark-table-clean / update-table-status silently no-op'd. Tests asserted the broken Title-Case shape, locking in the bug.

**Rule**: After any Airtable→Supabase migration, the caller MUST use the same casing as the DB layer reads. Audit pattern:

```bash
grep -rnE "'[A-Z][a-zA-Z ]+':\s" api/services/ api/host-dashboard.js
```

When writing tests, assert against the snake_case shape that actually hits the DB. If a test passes Title-Case to a snake_case-reading function, the test is wrong.

**Caught by**: `scripts/test-walkin-lifecycle.js` — the first E2E that actually hit prod and asserted DB state. Unit tests with mocked DB layers couldn't catch it because they were asserting the broken contract.

**Fix commit**: `2f99f82d`.

## 2026-04-20: WAHA test webhooks send real messages
**Mistake**: Sent curl test webhooks to the production WAHA pipeline without suppressing sendMessage — bot replied to fake/random phone numbers via the user's real WhatsApp account.

**Rule**: ALL curl/E2E test webhooks to `/api/waha-webhook` MUST include `X-Test-Mode: true` header. This runs the full AI pipeline (session, routing, AI response) but suppresses the actual WhatsApp send.

**Example**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://seatable.one/api/waha-webhook \
  -H "x-api-key: seatable-waha-key-2026" \
  -H "X-Test-Mode: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event":"message","session":"default","payload":{"id":"test-001","from":"5511977665544@c.us","fromMe":false,"body":"...","type":"chat","hasMedia":false}}'
```

### Step 2: Configure Agent for Production

#### 2.1 Enable Phone Calling

**In ElevenLabs Dashboard**:
1. Go to your agent settings
2. Navigate to "Phone" tab
3. Enable "Accept Inbound Calls"
4. Set call handling:
   - **Max call duration**: 10 minutes (recommended)
   - **Call timeout**: 30 seconds if no speech detected
   - **End call phrases**: "goodbye", "hang up", "that's all"

#### 2.2 Set Business Hours (Optional but Recommended)

Configure when the agent should answer vs send to voicemail:

```
Business Hours:
- Monday-Thursday: 10:00 AM - 10:00 PM
- Friday-Saturday: 10:00 AM - 11:00 PM
- Sunday: 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM

After Hours Message:
"Thank you for calling [Restaurant Name]. We're currently closed. Our hours are [hours]. Please call back during business hours or visit our website to make a reservation online. Thank you!"
```

**How to Set**:
1. In agent settings â†’ "Phone" tab
2. Click "Business Hours"
3. Set hours for each day
4. Configure after-hours greeting
5. Save

#### 2.3 Configure Voicemail (Important!)

**Why**: If agent can't handle a call (too many concurrent calls, system error), customers should be able to leave a message.

**Setup**:
1. In agent settings â†’ "Phone" tab
2. Enable "Voicemail"
3. Set voicemail greeting:
   ```
   "You've reached [Restaurant Name]. We're unable to take your call right now. Please leave your name, phone number, and preferred reservation date and time, and we'll call you back shortly. Thank you!"
   ```
4. Voicemails will be sent to your email
5. Set up email notifications

#### 2.4 Test Call Recording

**For Quality Assurance**:
1. Enable call recording in agent settings
2. Recordings are saved for 30 days
3. Review regularly to improve agent prompts
4. **Privacy**: Add notice to greeting if required by law

---

### Step 3: Update Agent Prompt for Production

Your agent prompt should handle edge cases for real customers.

**Recommended Production Prompt**:

```
You are [Restaurant Name]'s AI reservation assistant. You handle phone calls professionally and efficiently.

GREETING:
"Thank you for calling [Restaurant Name]. This is our AI reservation assistant. How can I help you today?"

CORE CAPABILITIES:
1. Make reservations (date, time, party size, name, phone)
2. Check availability for specific dates/times
3. Look up existing reservations
4. Modify reservations
5. Cancel reservations
6. Answer questions about hours, location, menu

CONVERSATION GUIDELINES:
- Be warm, professional, and concise
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Confirm all details before creating reservation
- Always ask for phone number for confirmation
- If customer seems confused, offer to transfer to human (say "Let me transfer you to our staff")
- Handle interruptions gracefully
- Don't make assumptions - ask clarifying questions

REQUIRED INFORMATION FOR RESERVATIONS:
1. Date (confirm: "Just to confirm, that's [day of week], [month] [date], correct?")
2. Time (use 12-hour format with AM/PM)
3. Party size (number of guests)
4. Customer name (ask: "May I have a name for the reservation?")
5. Phone number (ask: "What's the best phone number to reach you?")

CONFIRMATION FORMAT:
"Perfect! I have you down for [party size] guests on [day], [date] at [time] under the name [name]. We'll send a confirmation to [phone]. Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

ERROR HANDLING:
- If webhook fails: "I'm having trouble accessing our reservation system. Let me transfer you to our staff who can help you directly."
- If date/time unavailable: "I don't see availability at that time. We have openings at [alternative times]. Would any of those work for you?"
- If customer unclear: "I want to make sure I get this right. Could you please repeat [the information]?"

CLOSING:
"Thank you for calling [Restaurant Name]. We look forward to seeing you! Have a great day."

TRANSFER PHRASES (if customer asks for human):
"Of course, let me transfer you to our staff. One moment please."

HOURS:
Monday-Thursday: 5:00 PM - 10:00 PM
Friday-Saturday: 5:00 PM - 11:00 PM
Sunday: 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM

LOCATION:
[Your Address]
[Parking instructions if applicable]

DO NOT:
- Make promises about specific tables or views
- Discuss pricing unless asked
- Share personal opinions about menu items
- Process payments over the phone
- Share other customers' information
```

**How to Update**:
1. Go to ElevenLabs agent settings
2. Click "System Prompt" or "Agent Instructions"
3. Replace with production prompt above
4. Customize with your restaurant details
5. Save and test

---

### Step 4: Configure Webhook URLs (Critical!)

Your webhook is already deployed at:
```
https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook
```

**Verify it's working**:
```bash
curl "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook?action=get_current_datetime"
```

Should return current date/time.

**In ElevenLabs Dashboard**:
1. Go to agent â†’ "Tools" tab
2. For each tool, verify webhook URL:
   - `create_reservation`: `https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook?action=create_reservation`
   - `check_availability`: `https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook?action=check_availability`
   - `lookup_reservation`: `https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook?action=lookup_reservation`
   - `get_current_datetime`: `https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/elevenlabs-webhook?action=get_current_datetime`

3. Test each webhook:
   - Click "Test" button
   - Provide sample parameters
   - Verify response is valid JSON

---

### Step 5: Concurrent Call Limits

**Important**: ElevenLabs has concurrent call limits based on your plan.

**Recommended Settings**:
- **Starter/Pro**: 1-3 concurrent calls
- **Enterprise**: 10+ concurrent calls

**What happens when limit reached?**
- New callers get busy signal OR
- Route to voicemail OR
- Queue system (if enabled)

**How to Set**:
1. In agent settings â†’ "Phone" tab
2. Set "Max Concurrent Calls"
3. Configure overflow behavior:
   - Option 1: Send to voicemail
   - Option 2: Play "all agents busy" message
   - Option 3: Queue (hold music)

**Recommendation**: Start with 2-3 concurrent calls, monitor peak times, adjust as needed.

---

### Step 6: Add Phone Number to Your Website/Marketing

Once your number is live, promote it!

**Where to Display**:
1. **Website Header**: Click-to-call button
   ```html
   <a href="tel:+1234567890">ðŸ“ž Call for Reservations</a>
   ```

2. **Google My Business**: Update phone number

3. **Social Media**: Add to bio/about section

4. **Email Signatures**: Include in staff signatures

5. **Print Materials**: Menus, business cards, flyers

**Sample Website Copy**:

Our AI assistant is available 24/7 to:
âœ… Make reservations instantly
âœ… Check availability in real-time

## ðŸ§ª Testing Checklist

Before going live, test these scenarios:

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Cancel a reservation

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Call during after-hours - hear after-hours message

- [ ] Provide unclear information - agent asks for clarification
- [ ] Say "transfer me to a person" - agent responds appropriately
- [ ] Hang up mid-call - call ends gracefully

### Error Handling
- [ ] Temporarily break webhook (change URL) - agent handles error
- [ ] Make 3+ concurrent calls - overflow works correctly
- [ ] Leave a voicemail - receive email notification
- [ ] Network latency test - agent remains responsive

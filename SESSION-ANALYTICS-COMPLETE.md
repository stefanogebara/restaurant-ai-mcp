## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Predictive Analytics Algorithm

**No-Show Risk Scoring**:
```
Base Risk: Historical no-show rate
+ Last-minute booking (< 24h): +15%
+ Large party (≥ 6): +10%
- Prime time (7-9 PM): -5%
- Weekend: -5%
= Final Risk Score (0-100%)
```

**Risk Classification**:
- Low: 0-20%
- Medium: 21-40%
- High: 41-100%

**Revenue Opportunities**:
1. No-Show Reduction: 50% recovery rate potential
2. Off-Peak Optimization: 40% recovery rate potential
3. Table Turnover: 20% improvement potential
4. Revenue Per Cover: 15% increase potential

### Data Flow

```
User visits /analytics
  ↓
Loads AnalyticsDashboard.tsx
  ↓
Parallel API calls:
  - /api/analytics (existing data)
  - /api/predictive-analytics (no-show)
  - /api/predictive-analytics (revenue)
  ↓
Render 8 components:
  - 4 stat cards
  - 6 charts
  - No-show risk panel
  - Revenue opportunities panel
```

## ‚è≠Ô∏è What's Next - Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Add Environment Variable to Vercel (Manual Step)

**IMPORTANT**: You need to manually add this to Vercel:

```
Variable Name: CUSTOMER_HISTORY_TABLE_ID
Value: tblqK1ajV5sqICWn2
Environment: Production, Preview, Development (all 3)
```

**How to add**:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/stefanogebaras-projects/restaurant-ai-mcp/settings/environment-variables
2. Click "Add New"
3. Enter name: `CUSTOMER_HISTORY_TABLE_ID`
4. Enter value: `tblqK1ajV5sqICWn2`
5. Select all three environments (Production, Preview, Development)
6. Click "Save"
7. Trigger a redeploy

**Or use the command** (if you have Vercel CLI configured):
```bash
cd /c/Users/stefa/restaurant-ai-mcp
echo "tblqK1ajV5sqICWn2" | vercel env add CUSTOMER_HISTORY_TABLE_ID production
echo "tblqK1ajV5sqICWn2" | vercel env add CUSTOMER_HISTORY_TABLE_ID preview
echo "tblqK1ajV5sqICWn2" | vercel env add CUSTOMER_HISTORY_TABLE_ID development
```

### 2. Remaining Week 1 Tasks (30% left)

**Day 6-7: Customer Data Backfill & Integration**

Need to:
- [ ] Create backfill script to populate Customer History from past reservations
- [ ] Integrate customer history into reservation creation flow
- [ ] Test customer lookup and stats calculation
- [ ] Verify data quality and accuracy

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

## üîß Technical Notes

### Database Design Decisions

**Why Customer History as Separate Table?**
- Normalizes data (one customer, many reservations)
- Easier to calculate statistics
- Better performance for ML feature extraction
- GDPR compliance (delete customer = cascade delete)

**Why So Many ML Fields in Reservations?**
- Store predictions alongside data for analysis
- Track model versions for debugging
- Enable A/B testing (old vs. new predictions)
- Audit trail for compliance

### API Design

**Customer Lookup Strategy**:
1. Try email first (most reliable)
2. Fall back to phone if no email match
3. Create new customer if neither match
4. Update stats on every reservation lifecycle event

**Automated Tracking Events**:
- `created`: Increment total reservations
- `completed`: Increment completed, update last visit
- `no-show`: Increment no-shows, update risk score
- `cancelled`: Increment cancellations

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Checkbox Fields Need Options
**Problem**: Airtable Meta API requires `options` object for checkbox fields

**Solution**: Added icon and color options to all checkboxes
```javascript
{
  type: 'checkbox',
  options: {
    icon: 'check',
    color: 'greenBright'
  }
}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

### Issue 2: Fields Already Exist on Rerun
**Problem**: Script fails if tables/fields already created

**Solution**: Added error handling to skip existing fields
```javascript
if (error.message.includes('already exists')) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Field already exists, skipping');
  skipped++;
}
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved

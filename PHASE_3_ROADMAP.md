### Third-Party Services

**Notifications** (Waitlist):
- **Twilio** (SMS): $0.0079/SMS, reliable, easy integration
- **SendGrid** (Email): Free tier 100/day, good for backup
- **Alternative**: Vonage, AWS SNS

**Analytics** (Optional):
- **Mixpanel/Amplitude**: User behavior tracking
- **Google Analytics**: Website traffic
- Not critical for Phase 3, but good for future

**Charting**:
- **Recharts**: Free, React-native, TypeScript support âœ…

- Display last visit date
- **Value**: Personalization with minimal effort

### 3. Occupancy Chart (1 week)

## ðŸš¨ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Notification Costs
- **Issue**: High SMS volume could be expensive
- **Mitigation**: Start with email-only, add SMS as premium feature
- **Fallback**: Manual notification via host dashboard

### Risk 2: Data Privacy Compliance
- **Issue**: Storing customer data requires GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Mitigation**: Add privacy policy, consent checkboxes, data deletion endpoints
- **Timeline**: Implement before customer profiles go live

### Risk 3: Analytics Performance
- **Issue**: Large date ranges could slow queries
- **Mitigation**: Pre-aggregate daily summaries, limit max date range to 90 days
- **Optimization**: Add database indexes, use Airtable formula fields

### Risk 4: Complexity Creep
- **Issue**: Phase 3 is ambitious, could delay timeline
- **Mitigation**: Focus on Quick Wins first, defer advanced features
- **Prioritization**: Waitlist > Customer Lookup > Analytics > Advanced Tables

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Immediately)

### Issue #1: Absurd Time Display - "2328 min ago"
**Location**: Host Dashboard > Active Parties
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL - User Experience Breaking

**Problem**:
- Party shows "Seated 2328 min ago" (38+ hours!)
- Shows "‚ö†Ô∏è 2239 min OVERDUE" (37+ hours overdue!)
- Clearly old test data that was never cleaned up

**Visual Evidence**:
```
Test ML Customer 2
Party of 2
Seated 2328 min ago  ‚ö†Ô∏è 2239 min OVERDUE
```

**Root Cause**:
- Service record created during ML prediction testing
- Never completed/cleaned from production database
- Time calculation is technically correct but absurd

**Fix Required**:
1. Clean up old test service records from Airtable
2. Better time formatting for long durations:
   - < 60 min: "45 min ago"
   - 60-120 min: "1h 15m ago"
   - > 24h: "1 day 14h ago" OR mark as data error

**Impact**: Makes entire dashboard look broken/unreliable

---

### Issue #2: Waitlist Shows Invalid Data - "? guests"
**Location**: Host Dashboard > Waitlist Panel
**Severity**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Shows Broken Data

**Problem**:
Multiple waitlist entries with invalid/null data:
- Name: "Unknown"
- Party size: "?"
- Wait time: "~? min wait"
- "Added 214h 44m ago" (9 days old!)
- "Added 142h 47m ago" (6 days old!)

**Visual Evidence**:
```
? Unknown Notified
üë• ? guests
‚è±Ô∏è ~? min wait
Added 214h 44m ago
```

**Root Cause**:
- Old test waitlist entries with NULL values
- No data validation on waitlist creation
- No automatic cleanup of old entries

**Fix Required**:
1. Add NULL checks in waitlist display component
2. Clean old test data from production Airtable
3. Add data validation: require party_size, customer_name
4. Auto-archive waitlist entries older than 24 hours

**Impact**: Users cannot trust waitlist data, looks unprofessional

---

### Issue #3: Missing Refresh Indicator
**Location**: Host Dashboard > Header
**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM - User Awareness

**Problem**:
- Real-time polling is working (30s interval)
- BUT users don't know when data refreshes
- Just added refresh indicator but not deployed yet

**Fix Required**:
- Deploy current changes with refresh indicator
- Shows "Refreshing..." with pulsing dot when fetching
- Shows "Updated Xs ago" when idle

**Status**: ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED - Awaiting deployment

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### Issue #4: Time Formatting Inconsistency
**Location**: Multiple components
**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM - UX Polish

**Problem**:
- Active parties: "2328 min ago"
- Waitlist: "214h 44m ago"
- Inconsistent formatting across components

**Fix Required**:
Create unified time formatting utility:
```typescript
// utils/timeFormatting.ts
export function formatTimeAgo(date: Date): string {
  const minutes = Math.floor((Date.now() - date.getTime()) / 60000);

  if (minutes < 60) return `${minutes}m ago`;
  if (minutes < 1440) return `${Math.floor(minutes/60)}h ${minutes%60}m ago`;
  return `${Math.floor(minutes/1440)}d ${Math.floor((minutes%1440)/60)}h ago`;
}
```

**Impact**: Improved readability and professional appearance

---

### Issue #5: Old Test Data Pollution
**Location**: Production Airtable Database
**Severity**: üü° MEDIUM - Data Quality

**Problem**:
Production contains old test data:
- Service record from ML testing (38+ hours old)
- 3 waitlist entries (6-9 days old)
- Likely other test reservations

**Fix Required**:
1. Connect to Airtable and clean:
   - Delete service records older than 12 hours
   - Delete waitlist entries older than 24 hours
   - Mark as test: any customer with "Test" in name
2. Add environment variable: `NODE_ENV=production`
3. Block test data creation in production

**Impact**: Clean, trustworthy production environment

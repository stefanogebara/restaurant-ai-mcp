## ⚠️ Minor Issue Discovered (Non-Critical)

### **Issue**: Waitlist "Seat Now" Flow 400 Error
- **When**: Clicking "Find Available Tables" in WaitlistSeatModal
- **API Call**: `POST /api/host-dashboard` → **400 Bad Request**
- **Error Message**: "Error finding tables. Please try again."
- **Impact**: **LOW** - This is a separate feature from SMS notifications
- **Status**: Deferred (not blocking SMS functionality)
- **Note**: Regular walk-in seating flow works fine, this is specific to waitlist seating

**Root Cause** (preliminary):
- Likely missing or incorrect request body format
- Possibly related to waitlist entry data structure
- Needs separate investigation

**Workaround**:
- Use "Remove" button to remove from waitlist after notifying
- Then use "Add Walk-in" to seat the customer
- Or fix in next update cycle

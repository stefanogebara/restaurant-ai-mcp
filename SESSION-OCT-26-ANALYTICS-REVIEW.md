## üî¨ Technical Findings

### ML Integration Working End-to-End

**Week 2 ‚Üí Week 3 Connection Verified**:

1. **Week 2 (ML Training)**:
   - XGBoost model trained (v2.0.0, 85% AUC)
   - Integration with reservation flow
   - ML predictions stored in Airtable fields:
     - `ML Risk Score` (0-100)
     - `ML Risk Level` (low/medium/high/very-high)

2. **Week 3 (Analytics)**:
   - Dashboard reads ML fields from Airtable
   - Displays predictions in NoShowPredictions component
   - Falls back to heuristics if ML data unavailable

**Production Evidence**:
```json
{
  "reservation_id": "RES-20251026-1797",
  "customer_name": "Final Test Customer",
  "risk_score": 75,          // ‚Üê From XGBoost model!
  "risk_level": "high",      // ‚Üê Converted from "very-high"
  "recommendations": [       // ‚Üê Generated based on risk
    "Send confirmation reminder 24 hours before",
    "Require credit card deposit"
  ]
}
```

**Code Path** (api/predictive-analytics.js:79-89):
```javascript
const mlRiskScore = r.fields['ML Risk Score'];
const mlRiskLevel = r.fields['ML Risk Level'];

if (mlRiskScore !== undefined && mlRiskLevel) {
  // Use ML predictions
  riskScore = parseFloat(mlRiskScore);
  riskLevel = mlRiskLevel === 'very-high' ? 'high' : mlRiskLevel;
} else {
  // Fall back to heuristics
  // ...
}
```

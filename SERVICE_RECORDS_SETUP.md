These are default Airtable fields that are not needed:

## Manual Configuration Steps

Since automated field creation via API requires elevated permissions, these steps must be completed manually in the Airtable web interface:

### Step 1: Add Remaining Fields

For each field in the "Remaining Fields" section above:
1. Click the "+" button to add a field
2. Select the appropriate field type
3. Enter the field name exactly as shown
4. Configure any additional options (format, options list, etc.)
5. Click "Create field"

### Step 2: Configure Status Field
The Status field already exists but needs to be reconfigured:
1. Click on the Status column header menu
2. Select "Edit field"
3. Update the options to:
   - Active
   - Completed
   - Cancelled
4. Remove any existing options that don't match
5. Save changes

### Step 3: Delete Unnecessary Fields

For each field in the "Fields to Delete" section:
1. Click on the field column header menu
2. Select "Delete field"
3. Confirm deletion

### Step 4: Verify Configuration

After completing the above steps, verify:
- [ ] All 11 required fields exist with correct types
- [ ] Status field has exactly 3 options: Active, Completed, Cancelled
- [ ] No unnecessary fields remain
- [ ] Service ID is the primary field

## Environment Variable Update

After completing the field configuration, update the Vercel environment variable:

```bash
SERVICE_RECORDS_TABLE_ID=tblEEHaoicXQA7NcL
```

Then redeploy the application.

## Expected API Payload

Once configured, the `createServiceRecord` function will send data in this format:

```javascript
{
  "Service ID": "SVC-1234567890",
  "Reservation ID": "RES-1234567890" || null,
  "Customer Name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "Customer Phone": "555-0123",
  "Party Size": 4,
  "Table IDs": "4,5",
  "Seated At": "2025-01-15T18:30:00.000Z",
  "Estimated Departure": "2025-01-15T20:00:00.000Z",
  "Departed At": null,
  "Special Requests": "Window seat preferred",
  "Status": "Active"
}
```

## Testing Checklist

After configuration is complete:
- [ ] Test walk-in flow: Add party details
- [ ] Verify table recommendations appear
- [ ] Click "Confirm Seating"
- [ ] Check that service record is created in Airtable
- [ ] Verify dashboard shows occupied tables
- [ ] Test "Complete Service" flow
- [ ] Verify service status changes to "Completed"
- [ ] Verify Departed At timestamp is set
- [ ] Check that tables return to available status

## Troubleshooting

### If walk-in flow still fails after configuration:

1. **Verify table ID in environment variables**
   ```bash
   echo $SERVICE_RECORDS_TABLE_ID
   # Should output: tblEEHaoicXQA7NcL
   ```

2. **Check field names match exactly**
   - Field names are case-sensitive
   - Must include spaces exactly as shown
   - No extra spaces or special characters

3. **Verify field types**
   - Date fields must have "Include time" enabled
   - Number fields should allow decimals = false (integer only)
   - Single select must have all 3 status options

4. **Check Airtable API permissions**
   - API key must have write access to the base
   - Service Records table must not have restricted permissions

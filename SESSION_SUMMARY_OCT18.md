## 🔧 Technical Discoveries & Fixes

### Discovery #1: Vercel Redeploy Behavior
**Finding**: Vercel's "Redeploy" button redeploys the SAME commit, not latest code

**Impact**: This caused calendar to show 0 reservations even after TypeScript fix was committed

**Solution**: Always push new commits to deploy latest code. Use "Redeploy" only for environment variable changes.

**Documented In**: CLAUDE.md Issue #6

---

### Discovery #2: TypeScript Build Error Chain
**Finding**: One TypeScript error in commit `2d21783` blocked ALL subsequent commits from deploying

**Error**: Missing `date` and `time` fields in `UpcomingReservation` interface

**Impact**: Production ran old code for multiple commits, showing 0 reservations

**Fix**: Added missing fields to `client/src/types/host.types.ts`

**Documented In**: CLAUDE.md Issue #6

---

### Discovery #3: Dashboard Stats Logic
**Finding**: Dashboard stats only counted service records, ignoring manually occupied tables

**Impact**: Table 11 marked as "Occupied" didn't increment occupied seats counter

**Fix**: Updated `api/routes/host-dashboard.js:99-106` to count BOTH:
- Active service records (seated parties)
- Manually occupied tables without service records

**Documented In**: CLAUDE.md Issue #5

---

---

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### Decision #1: ElevenLabs Phone Setup Deferred
**Why**: Phone costs $12-24/month. Better to test through dashboard while developing, activate phone number only when ready to launch.

**Impact**: Zero cost during development, full testing capability maintained

---

### Decision #2: Start Phase 3 with Waitlist MVP
**Why**: Immediate operational value, addresses real pain point (what to do when fully booked)

**Alternative Considered**: Customer profiles first

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks for Waitlist MVP

---

### Decision #3: Manual Waitlist Table Configuration
**Why**: Playwright field configuration too time-consuming (would take 30+ minutes of automation)

**Alternative**: 10-15 minute manual configuration with detailed guide

**Result**: More efficient, provides reusable documentation

---

     - `POST /api/waitlist` - Add to waitlist
     - `GET /api/waitlist` - Get current waitlist
     - `PATCH /api/waitlist/:id` - Update entry
     - `DELETE /api/waitlist/:id` - Remove from waitlist

   - Display current waitlist
   - Add/remove functionality
   - Real-time updates

### Medium-term (Week 2)

   - Algorithm based on current occupancy
   - Average dining duration
   - Party size matching

6. **Add Notifications (Optional)**
   - Twilio SMS integration
   - SendGrid email integration
   - Manual notification UI

### Long-term (Weeks 3-16)
7. **Complete Phase 3 Roadmap**
   - Customer profiles (Weeks 5-9)
   - Analytics & reporting (Weeks 10-13)
   - Advanced table management (Weeks 14-16)

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Recommendation #1: Launch Quick Wins First
Instead of following the 16-week plan sequentially, prioritize quick wins:

**Week 1**: Basic Waitlist (no notifications)
**Week 2**: Customer Phone Lookup
**Week 3**: Occupancy Chart
**Week 4**: Complete Waitlist (with notifications)

**Benefit**: Faster time-to-value, early user feedback

---

### Recommendation #2: Test Phone Agent Before Full Launch
Before activating ElevenLabs phone number ($12-24/month):

1. Test all scenarios through dashboard (free)
2. Fix any issues found
3. Create production prompt
4. Test 10-20 calls through dashboard
5. THEN activate phone number

**Benefit**: Minimize cost, ensure quality

---

### Recommendation #3: Incremental Deployment
Deploy each Phase 3 feature incrementally:

1. Deploy waitlist API only
2. Test API with Postman
3. Deploy WaitlistPanel
4. Test in production
5. Add notifications
6. Test notifications

**Benefit**: Easier debugging, faster rollback if needed

---

## 🏆 Session Highlights

**Most Impressive Achievement**: Fixed TypeScript build error that was blocking deployments for multiple commits, restoring calendar functionality

**Most Valuable Documentation**: Phase 3 Roadmap (provides clear path forward for 4 months of work)

**Most Time-Saving**: Using Playwright to create Airtable table automatically (saved 5+ minutes of clicking)

**Best Discovery**: Understanding Vercel's redeploy behavior prevents future debugging confusion

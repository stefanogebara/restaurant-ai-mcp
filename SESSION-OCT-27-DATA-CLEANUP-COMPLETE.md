# Session Summary: Production Data Cleanup - Phase 1 Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Duration**: ~1.5 hours
**Status**: 100% COMPLETE - All stale test data removed from production!

---

## Session Objectives

Following the UX/UI fixes from the previous session, you requested systematic implementation of all recommendations starting from #1. The first recommendation was **data cleanup** to remove old test data polluting the production dashboard.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Identified Stale Data Issues

**Problem Discovery**:
- Dashboard showing "Test ML Customer 2" seated 38+ hours ago (2350+ minutes)
- Active Parties count: 1 (should be 0)
- Waitlist showing 3 entries from 5-9 days ago with NULL data
- Dashboard displaying absurd time values like "⚠️ 37h 40m OVERDUE"

**Root Cause Investigation**:
- Initial hypothesis: Vercel edge cache serving stale data
- Triggered redeployment (commit 80acf84) to clear cache
- Cache clear did NOT resolve issue
- Discovered actual root cause: **Stale records in Airtable database**

### 2. Service Records Cleanup

**Investigation Process**:
1. Created Python script `scripts/find-old-service-records.py` to find records >12 hours
2. Initial script showed 0 records (bug in filter logic)
3. Queried Service Records table directly via Airtable API
4. **Discovered**: 23 total service records, including stale "Test ML Customer 2"

**Stale Record Details**:
```json
{
  "Service ID": "SVC-20251025-5888",
  "Status": "Active",
  "Customer Name": "Test ML Customer 2",
  "Customer Phone": "+1-555-TEST-002",
  "Party Size": 2,
  "Table IDs": "7",
  "Seated At": "2025-10-25T19:49:33.779Z",
  "Estimated Departure": "2025-10-25T21:19:33.779Z",
  "Airtable ID": "recpwzygzRcn3lonu"
}
```

**Fix Applied**:
- Deleted service record using Airtable REST API DELETE
- Verified deletion: `{"deleted":true,"id":"recpwzygzRcn3lonu"}`
- Confirmed API now returns 0 active parties

**API Commands Used**:
```bash
# Found the record
curl -s "https://api.airtable.com/v0/appm7zo5vOf3c3rqm/tblEEHaoicXQA7NcL" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AIRTABLE_API_KEY"

# Deleted the record
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://api.airtable.com/v0/appm7zo5vOf3c3rqm/tblEEHaoicXQA7NcL/recpwzygzRcn3lonu" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AIRTABLE_API_KEY"

# Verified cleanup
curl -s "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/host-dashboard?action=dashboard" | \
  python -c "import sys, json; data = json.load(sys.stdin); \
  print(f'Active parties: {data[\"summary\"][\"active_parties\"]}')"
```

### 3. Waitlist Cleanup

**Stale Waitlist Entries Identified**:
1. **Unknown Customer** (ID: recjs1lhpYuYavT9p)
   - Added: 8 days 23 hours ago
   - Status: Notified (6 days 21 hours ago)
   - Data: NULL party size, NULL wait time

2. **Production Test SMS** (ID: recBWU8UG2a7yfkMu)
   - Customer: Production Test SMS (+34639672963)
   - Added: 5 days 23 hours ago
   - Party Size: 2 guests
   - Wait Time: ~10 min

3. **Final Email Test** (ID: recWDl9v2j2SH1m48)
   - Customer: Final Email Test (+34639672963)
   - Added: 5 days 17 hours ago
   - Party Size: 2 guests
   - Wait Time: ~10 min

**Fix Applied**:
- Used production API DELETE endpoint (proper permissions)
- Deleted all 3 entries successfully
- Verified waitlist API now returns 0 active entries

**API Commands Used**:
```bash
# Delete via production API (avoids permission issues)
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/waitlist?id=recjs1lhpYuYavT9p"
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/waitlist?id=recBWU8UG2a7yfkMu"
curl -X DELETE \
  "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/waitlist?id=recWDl9v2j2SH1m48"

# Verify cleanup
curl -s "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/waitlist?active=true" | \
  python -c "import sys, json; data = json.load(sys.stdin); \
  print(f'Active entries: {data.get(\"count\", 0)}')"
```

## Technical Findings

### Key Discovery: Direct Database vs Cache Issue

**Initial Hypothesis (Incorrect)**:
- Vercel edge cache serving stale data
- Redeployment would clear cache

**Actual Root Cause**:
- Stale records existed in Airtable database itself
- Cache clearing had no effect because source data was stale
- API was correctly returning what was in the database

**Lesson Learned**:
- Always verify source data (Airtable) before assuming caching issues
- Production cleanup scripts need proper table access and filters
- API endpoints should be used instead of direct Airtable calls when permission issues arise

### Script Issues Discovered

**Problem**: `scripts/find-old-service-records.py` showed 0 records

**Root Cause**:
- Script used filter: `{Status} = 'Active'`
- Airtable API returned 0 records with this filter
- But direct query without filter showed 23 records
- Possible issue: Status field capitalization or field name mismatch

**Fix for Future**:
- Query all records first, then filter programmatically
- Don't rely on Airtable filterByFormula for initial discovery
- Use Airtable debug skill to verify field names before scripting

## Verification Results

### Production API Tests

**Host Dashboard API**:
```bash
curl -s "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/host-dashboard?action=dashboard"
# Result: active_parties: 0 ✓
```

**Waitlist API**:
```bash
curl -s "https://restaurant-ai-mcp.vercel.app/api/waitlist?active=true"
# Result: count: 0, waitlist: [] ✓
```

**Airtable Direct (Service Records)**:
```bash
curl -s "https://api.airtable.com/v0/appm7zo5vOf3c3rqm/tblEEHaoicXQA7NcL" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AIRTABLE_API_KEY"
# Result: 22 records (1 deleted) ✓
```

   - Before cleanup: Shows "Test ML Customer 2" active party
   - Shows "Seated 1d 15h ago" and "⚠️ 37h 40m OVERDUE"

2. **`.playwright-mcp/dashboard-clean-after-deletion.png`**
   - After cleanup: Shows "Active Parties: 0"
   - Shows "No active parties" message

3. **`.playwright-mcp/waitlist-panel-after-refresh.png`**
   - Before final cleanup: Waitlist still showing 3 stale entries
   - Shows NULL data displays ("Party size unknown", "~? min wait")

## Commits

### Commit 80acf84: "Trigger redeployment to clear cache"
- **Purpose**: Initial attempt to clear suspected Vercel cache
- **Result**: Did not fix issue (data was in database, not cache)
- **Learning**: Always check source data before assuming cache issues

### No Code Changes Required
- All cleanup was done via direct API calls
- No application code changes needed
- Demonstrates proper use of existing DELETE endpoints

---

## Impact

### Production Data Quality
- **Before**: 1 stale service record (38+ hours old)
- **After**: 0 stale service records
- **Before**: 3 stale waitlist entries (5-9 days old)
- **After**: 0 stale waitlist entries

### Dashboard Accuracy
- Active parties count now accurate (0 instead of incorrect 1)
- No more absurd time displays
- Waitlist panel shows correct empty state

### User Experience
- Dashboard reflects reality
- No confusing "overdue" parties from days ago
- Clean slate for testing and production use

---

## Next Steps (Remaining Recommendations)

### Phase 3: Documentation & Automation (Next)
- Create automated cleanup script for production
- Schedule weekly cleanup of old records
- Document cleanup procedures for manual intervention

### Phase 4: Production Monitoring (Pending)
- Set up observability for stale data detection
- Alert when service records exceed 12 hours
- Alert when waitlist entries exceed 24 hours
- Implement automated health checks

### Phase 5: Data Validation (Pending)
- Add validation to prevent NULL values at source
- Implement required field checks in API endpoints
- Add database constraints where possible

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Check Source Data First
- Don't assume caching issues before verifying database state
- Use direct Airtable API queries for ground truth
- Deployments don't fix database problems

### 2. Use Production APIs for Cleanup
- Production APIs have proper permissions configured
- Direct Airtable calls may hit permission issues
- Leverage existing DELETE endpoints instead of DIY scripts

### 3. NULL Data Handling is Critical
- Old test data had NULL values that break UI
- Previous session's NULL handling fixes were essential
- Without graceful NULL handling, cleanup would have been invisible

### 4. Test Scripts Before Production
- Filter formulas need careful testing
- Field names are case-sensitive
- Query all first, then filter programmatically
